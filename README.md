The Hamburger menu is actually a checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, the overlay menu is visible.
 
CSS custom variables for colours and menu opening speed are defined in the root scope of style.css. This can be accessed in menu.css as well.

CSS transitions and the Transform property are used to produce a fancy toggler animation effect.
